### Problem:
With no access to information, the company didn't have a way or an official tool to share data, information, and KPIs. Preventing all areas from planning or predict situations, hindering growth.

### Goal:
Provide access to data, information, and insights in an easy and clear way, democratizing the data access inside the company.

### Structure of the problem:
I created a process to understand and cover all areas needs' related to data, and information. In some areas, they already had an idea about what they wanted, but in general, I needed to understand their daily work to instruct them better and present them with some possibilities.

This process starts with an initial alignment, in order to understand each area's specific demands. With all this information I organize the necessities, so as to cast the priorities, as well as to verify if all the data in need were available or if it is necessary to involve another team, like development or data engineering.

Second, planning is designed, following the priorities, aligned with the stakeholders, and other areas schedule, when it is necessary. I start using the already structured data, as well as, contacting other areas explaining our necessities, to structure this in parallel with the first analyses, as soon as they finish it, I include the analysis remaining, following the priorities determined before.

**Much more than giving the areas the information they asked for, my next step is to create an easy and readable way to access, ensuring accuracy, and fast update, for the purpose of transforming each stakeholder as much data-driven as possible, suggesting new analyses, information, and insights, often being the bridge between areas.**

After the first survey of demands is supplied, we continue with specific demands, which can come from the stakeholder, or from the data team as a suggestion.

### Implementation plan:
I’ve started the project with the Onboarding area, which was chosen by the data science manager, after this first project, each area was attended according to the necessities and priorities of the company.

Each project followed the process described before, first meeting, to understand their necessities, planning to attend to all their needs, contact and creation of new projects with other areas, when it was necessary, and help them to use the information.

To share all the information were, and still is, presented through dashboards and panels, using the business intelligence tool **Metabase**, using **SQL programing language**, with a direct link to **Redshift database**.

As described, some additional projects, in partnership with the development and data engineer team, were necessary in order to cover all area's needs. I was the bridge between the stakeholders and the teams. Responsible for understanding the necessity, identify that it wasn’t available and where it should be, direct the demand to the right team. After structuring the demand to the team, I needed to guarantee the delivery with accuracy.

### Results:
In **6 months** I could cover **47%** of the companies areas (from October/2020 to April/2021). **Eliminating all the complaints** related to lack of access information. Now the areas have more autonomy to work. After the projects, the areas started to **search for more and more data and information**, the process to become **more data-driven** has been natural. I helped to create a culture where stakeholders look for me asking for more data, information, explanation, and help.

An example of saving time happened on the customer success team, the automation of a daily manager report bring a **saving of 25%** in the **daily workday** to ~12 specialists. Before, this report was updated manually in google sheets daily.
