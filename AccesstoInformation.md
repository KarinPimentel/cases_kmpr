### Problem:

With no access to the company's information (like revenue, customer consumption, service quality, among others) the areas did not have a way or an official tool to share data, information, and KPIs. <p/>
Without this to compile and group the company reports, many processes became completely manual and slower. As well it was preventing the areas from tracking business and service success, blocking strategic planning in all areas, since production, to customer success, it was not possible to predict situations like a cancellation, hindering growth of the company.

### Goal:

Provide access to data, information, and insights in an easy and clear way, democratizing the data access inside the company. <p/>
Understand and define business rules and analytical approaches that fit each team's challenges.
Create metrics for tracking business and service success. <p/>
Sharing it through reports and dashboards in a self-service tool, providing more autonomy to the company's teams.
As well as transforming data analysis in business insights, to lead to significant business impact.


### Structure of the problem:
I created a process to understand and cover all teams needs' related to data, and information. In some areas, they already had an idea about what they wanted, with others we need to structure better and present them some possibilities.

__Much more than giving the areas the information they asked for, my goal is to create an easy and readable way to access, ensuring accuracy, and fast update data, for the purpose of transforming each team member as much data-driven as possible, suggesting new analyses, information, and insights, often being the bridge between areas.__

After the first survey of demands is supplied, we continue with specific demands, which can come from the stakeholder, or from the data team as a suggestion.

### Discoveries:
- Some areas, like customer success, didn’t have some process well defined. It was necessary to understand what they used to do, to structure and define a process, for then have a clear way to create metrics;
- Our software was not prepared to record many information, like due date of the products, date of pay bill by the customer, ...;
- New products weren't saved in the same document as the previous one, which, at some point, ended up as broken in our reports;
- The information that identifies the type and version as the equipment was not been recorded;
- The login, on our android app, never expired;
- Among others.

### Implementation plan:

I’ve started the project with the Onboarding area, which was chosen by the data science manager. After this first project, each area was attended according to the necessities and priorities of the company. <p/>
Each project followed the process described before, understanding their necessities, contacting and creating new projects with other areas, when it was necessary, and helping the teams to use the information. <p/>
To share all the information were, and still is, presented through dashboards and panels, using the business intelligence tool ___Metabase___, through ___SQL programming language___, with a direct link to our data lake (_Redshift database_).

### Business Impact:
In 6 months I could cover __47%__ of the company's areas (from October/2020 to April/2021). __Eliminating all the complaints__ related to lack of access information.<p/>
Now the areas have more autonomy to work. After the projects, the areas started to __search for more and more data and information__, the process to become more data-driven has been natural. I helped to create a culture where stakeholders look for me asking for more data, information, explanation, and help. <p/>
An example of saving time happened on the customer success team, the automation of a daily manager report brought a saving of __25%__ in the daily workday to __~12 specialists__. Before, this report was updated manually in google sheets daily.
