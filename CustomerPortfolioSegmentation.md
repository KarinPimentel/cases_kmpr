## Goal:

Create a way to clarify how we could classify and identify our clients to better understand our customer necessities and profile.

## Implementation plan:
Analyze our current customer portfolio to identify patterns that could help us to cluster customers, applying the Customer Success (CS) team’s previous knowledge about the customers to define their needs and the company’s interests.

We understood what we could offer at that point in terms of budget, customer service capacity, and customer requirements.

After that, we defined 5 categories, where each client would fit better according to the client's market segment. 

Each category became a part of our funnel of granularity of data, focused on how we would analyze our portfolio and provide customer service.

## Result: 
With this segmentation we reformulated KPIs related to our customers in an assertive way, expecting specific and distinct results according to the clients’ potential. The company grow in **52%** of clients, and **60,7%** of employees.
