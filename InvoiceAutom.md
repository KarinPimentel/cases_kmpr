### Problem:
There wasn't a link between the sale and the invoice.

### Goal:
Automate the process by linking the invoice to the sale id, eliminate the manual process, saving time, and improving productivity.

### Structure of the problem:
I needed to understand the structure of the software used, in order to get why this link didn't exist and how we could create it, solving the problem in a simple and fast way.
After this process of understanding the structure, it was necessary to contact our development team, to structure and insert the data in our transitional database. After that, get in touch with the data engineer team, to structure the data in our data lake, enabling the delivery of it to the area.

### Implementation plan:
After the process of understanding the structure, the development team and I designed a new structure to link both information in our transitional database. After that, I contacted the data engineer team, explaining the demand, they inserted the new structure on our data lake, enabling the delivery of it to the area.

## Result: 
This project helped mainly the financial and account department since we bind the sale to the invoice, helping them in the process of verifying and declare our fiscal information. This process was 100% manual, now it’s **automatic**, it became faster and more **accurate**, eliminating human errors. Since the change, that was made in April/2021, **more than 3K** service notes have already been issued in the company.
